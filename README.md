Smart Gen - Power Management System

Smart Gen is a cutting-edge project designed to help businesses and households manage their power needs efficiently. With Smart Gen, users can remotely control the operation of their generator, track fuel levels, and receive notifications for servicing due dates, all through a mobile app.
Key Features of Smart Gen:

    Remote On/Off Control: Switch your generator on or off from anywhere using the Smart Gen mobile app.
    Fuel Level Monitoring: Keep track of the fuel level of your generator, ensuring that you never run out of power unexpectedly.
    Servicing Notifications: Receive automatic reminders for servicing and maintenance based on your generator's usage, so you never miss a scheduled service.
    Automatic Changeover: Supports automatic changeover, ensuring that the power supply seamlessly switches between the generator and the main grid in case of any power failure.

The Smart Gen system includes hardware components that are attached directly to your generator, providing real-time monitoring and control, improving operational efficiency and convenience.

This is a new React Native project, bootstrapped using @react-native-community/cli.
Getting Started

    Note: Make sure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start

Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:
For Android

# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android

For iOS

# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

    Open App.tsx in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.

    For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Windows and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

    For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. ðŸŽ‰
